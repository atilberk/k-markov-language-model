# K-Markov Language Model
A K-Markov Language Model and Random Text Generator

This is a project I have implemented and done the complexity analysis for Algorithm Design and Anaylsis course taught by Dr. Alptekin Kupcu at Ko√ß University Computer Engineering Department.

The original project description can be found at [Princeton's COS226 Assignment in Fall'08](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos226/assignments/model.html).

Full report and complexity analysis on the project can be read on [REPORT.md](/REPORT.md)

### How to run?
```
$ python TextGenerator.py -K <Kvalue> -M <Mvalue> <source_file> <destination_file> [optional args]
```

### Arguments

**-K :** K value for Markov model  
**-M :** Number of characters to be generated  

**-v , --verbose :** Makes the output verbose  
**-q , --quiet :** Makes the output quite  
**-l , --log :** Writes the log into `log.txt`  
**-i , --ignore-new-line :** Ignores the newline character in input
